At the time, the company said the losses were the result of one-time losses, leaving the impression that the company could weather the bad quarterly results."", 'But two days earlier, Mr. Duncan warned the company\'s chief accounting officer, Rick Causey, that the way the company planned to disclose the information might be ""misconstrued or misunderstood by investors,"" according to a memo Mr. Duncan wrote to his files on Oct. 15 that was made available to Congressional investigators.

""We pointed out that such items are, more often than not, included in normal operating earnings in"" financial statements that are put together using generally accepted accounting practices.', 'The next day - the same day Enron disclosed the earnings press release that Mr. Duncan objected to - Ms. Temple, who had been involved in discussing the matter with Mr. Duncan, sent an e-mail message to Mr. Duncan and others at the firm suggesting that language be deleted from the memo ""that might suggest we have concluded the release is misleading.""', 'A copy of the message showed that Ms. Temple appeared to be worried about potential litigation on Enron\'s finances and she sought to remove her name from the list of people who received the document: ""If my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid.""', 'Ms. Temple\'s lawyer did not return a telephone call for comment. Mr. Leonard, the Andersen spokesman, said Ms. Temple was simply worried about waiving attorney-client privilege.

Mr. Duncan has told investigators he stopped shredding after Ms. Temple ordered it halted Nov. 9.', 'While Andersen officials have sought to blame Mr. Duncan and other employees in Houston office for the destruction of the documents, investigators are skeptical and want to probe why the firm waited more than two weeks after Enron disclosed the S.E.C. investigation to order the shredding stopped.', 'Mr. Greenwood said that in interviews with committee investigators, Mr. Duncan stated that on at least two occasions before Oct. 12, Ms. Temple asked him, ""How are you on compliance with the document-retention on Enron?""

We're the ones who actually believed that companies like Enron could, in our lifetimes, actually grow their earnings to justify such stratospheric, and historically unprecedented, multiples. Why did we believe it, despite all reason? Because we were greedy. "", 'Then there is the value crisis of the industry analysts, those morons who were still putting out ""buy"" notices on Enron even after it was apparent to even the most dimwitted observer that the companies was a dangerous house of cards. Either these people were perfect fools and dupes (which is precisely what they were hired not to be), or shills for Enron, or were covering their own investments. Whatever, they placed their own interests over the needs of their clients and the public at large. ', ""Next comes the cravenness of our elected representatives. So far, Enron's well-placed sacks of money seemed to have bought more largesse from the Clinton Adminstration than the Bush (big surprise), but that is hardly any consolation. The bottom line is that everybody Congress to the White House, GOP and Dem, took the money and then they took the calls. Do you think you could call the Treasury Secretary and get a prompt reply?

You have to act like a billion dollar company even as the office equipment company is repossessing the furniture.

The result is a growing gap between traditional ""book"" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. ', 'Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled ""goodwill."" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. ', 'That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called ""goodwill"" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point?

But there's not much of that he="", 're. Enron and Andersen officials hardly deny the dubious deals, the 881 off=', ""shore tax havens or the stupid accounting tricks. That's partly because nob="", 'ody can be sure that those dodges were inherently illegal. Many companies m=', 'aintain similar arrangements, usually intended to avoid taxes--a benefit of=', ' interest to Enron too. Enron avoided paying federal income tax for four ou=', 't of the last five years and instead received millions of dollars in federa=', 'l-tax refunds.=20', 'For now, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and federal agents probing=', "" Enron's fall are skipping over the accounting schemes and other questionab="", 'le business practices--including a bizarre sex angle: a scheme to offer por=', 'nography via the Internet.

Becaus=', 'e both firms were backed by Enron stock, Watkins knew their downfall was dr=', ""agging down Enron too.

As her lawyer Philip Hilder explain=', 's, ""The numbers just didn\'t add up.""=20', ""Already known as outspoken, Watkins didn't want to approach Skilling direct="", 'ly for fear of losing her job, Hilder says. ""She thought it would be fruitl=', 'ess while he was there."" When Skilling suddenly quit on Aug. 14, Lay called=', ' an all-employees meeting two days later and asked for comments from worker=', ""s beforehand.

Four days later Watkins called a friend at A="", 'ndersen and asked for advice. On Aug. 21 the friend drafted a memo detailin=', ""g Watkins' concerns for Andersen auditors on the Enron account.

This memo discusses those three meetings:', '>', '>  I. SUMMARY:', '> The following people attended these meetings:', '> *\t6/19/01 Conference Call (M. Molland, A. Smith, J. Wright, T. Reilly,', '> D. van Ulden; R. Williams)', '> *\t6/20/01 Meeting, at EES San Ramon (M. Molland, A. Smith, P.', '> Meringolo, D. van Ulden, T. Reilly, J. Eastlund, M. Ahad)', '> *\t6/21/01 Meeting, at EES Costa Mesa (A. Smith, J. Wright, T. Taylor)', '>', '> General Conclusions:', '> \tIt appears that while there may be a large volume of responsive', '> documents in both San Ramon (SR) and Costa Mesa (CM) (perhaps as much as', '> 50-100 boxes in each office, depending on how broadly we construe the', '> requests for information for EES\'s ""communications regarding decisions"" to', '> switch customers back to the utilities), there are relatively few highly', '> sensitive internal Enron documents which could be used to evidence the', '> alleged anti-trust violations or ""price-gouging.""  However, many of the', '> documents may contain proprietary customer information.', '> *\tIn all of our meetings with EES personnel, we emphasized what', '> constitutes a responsive document from a ""territorial"" perspective.  (i.e.', '> only documents in hard copy form in SR or CM or in electronic form on the', '> SR or CM servers.)  It appears that many account managers regularly', '> download and print documents from the Document data base (housed in', '> Houston) or the EES intranet.  Going forward, it will important to', '> emphasize that in collecting documents for possible production, EES', '> personnel should not download from these sources.', '> *\tWe also emphasized that EES personnel should not currently be', '> physically collecting documents, rather they should be assessing what', '> sensitive documents exist, locating responsive documents and NOT deleting', '> or destroying responsive material.', '> *\tMojhan Ahad and Tamara Taylor (Admins assigned to D. van Ulden and', '> J. Wright respectively) will be coordinating any document production that', '> becomes necessary.  It appears that a slightly different approach may be', '> necessary to recover responsive documents in SR and CM.  The account', '> managers in CM appear to have more independence with respect to managing', '> their accounts.  It may be necessary to speak with them directly.  In SR,', '> it appears that it may be possible to collect the large majority of', '> responsive documents directly from Tom, Dirk and Mojhan.', '> *\tOther than the personnel at SR and CM, there are other EES personnel', '> in California that we may need to meet.  Specifically, Sue Mara and Jeff', '> Dasovich with regulatory affairs in San Francisco and several Originators', '> in Long Beach (and possibly in Northern California?) who work from home.', '> This latter group may be particularly important as they appear to have', '> some account management responsibility on natural gas accounts and most', '> likely have some responsive documents.', '> *\tIt is unclear the extent to which the subpoena is common knowledge.', '> Dirk and Tom in SR stated that they had not revealed its existence to', '> their staff.  In CM, Jim had told his staff about the existence of the', '> subpoena but had not told them who it was from or what it referenced.  If', '> we proceed with the collection of responsive documents, we will need to', '> develop a policy with respect to the confidentiality of the subpoena.', '> *\tIt appears (based on conversations with Jim in CM) that although', '> general power point presentations are made up for meetings with customers', '> (in Houston, apparently), each account manager may change or focus the', '> presentation for a specific customer.  Therefore, each presentation will', '> constitute a different document and must be produced separately.', '> *\tNote on ""California Crisis"" database, Golden Bear and the de-DASR', '> documents:  These documents are probably the most sensitive, but many may', '> be protected on attorney-client, litigation or settlement privilege', '> grounds.  There are four Golden Bear team members in California:  Tom,', '> Dirk, Jim and George Waidelich.  It seems in SR, the Golden Bear documents', '> are only in the possession of Dirk and Tom.  However, in CM, account', '> managers may have some access to them.', '>', '> II. Recommendations Going Forward:', '> *\tCollect and assess most sensitive documents. These would include the', '> Golden Bear and de-DASR documents.  These should be collected next week in', '> order to begin a legal analysis of privilege issues.  In SR, this', '> collection can most likely be done by Mojhan.  In CM, it may be necessary', '> to interview individual account managers.', '> *\tMeet with ""floating"" Originators in Long Beach and potentially in', '> Northern California to assess if they possess any responsive documents.  A', '> brief conversation with the San Francisco Regulatory Affairs people (Sue', '> and Jeff) and with George Waidelich would also be warranted.  This should', '> also be done immediately.', '> *\tMeet with Tamara and Mojhan to develop a strategy for locating and', '> copying responsive hard copy documents.  This is underway.', '> *\tCopy the hard drive folders of key personnel onto CDs.  These', '> folders can then be reviewed for responsive documents by Brobeck attorneys', '> if a production becomes necessary.', '> *\tAssess the extent to which responsive data may reside in archival', '> storage sites (e.g. Iron Mountain in CM).  Because it may be', '> time-consuming to retrieve documents from these sites, we should know now', '> whether that will be necessary.', '> *\tAssess the potential implications of the EES intranet on our', '> production obligations.', '> *\tBegin developing a legal strategy to protect documents that are not', '> privileged but contain confidential proprietary customer information.', '> *\tEnsure document retention policy for appropriate personnel is in', '> place.', '>', '> DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS, ORGANIZATION, AND RETRIEVAL PLAN', '>', '> III. -Mail and Data Storage- Generally', '> During our conversation with Jon Eastlund, Manager for SR and CM e-mail', '> servers, and Pete Vandegon, Manager for SR and CM data servers, we', '> discussed the email and document retention policies.', '> Each document has its own server located at its California office. E-mail', '> remains on the server until it is deleted by EES user.  EES user can also', '> move e-mail onto their hard drive and delete from the server.  Every day', '> (from Monday to Thursday) a ""snapshot"" is taken of the e-mail servers and', '> is preserved on tapes at approximately 11pm.  When this snapshot is taken,', '> the corresponding day in the previous week is erased and written over.', '> Therefore, at 11pm on Wednesday, the snapshot of the previous Wednesday is', '> written over.  Similarly, each Friday, a snapshot of the server is taken,', '> writing over the Friday tape of the previous month.  In other words, there', '> exists at any time a daily snapshot of the past week and a weekly snapshot', '> of the last month.  Therefore, if an e-mail is received on a Tuesday and', '> deleted on a Wednesday, that e-mail would appear in the Tuesday daily', '> snapshot which would be preserved until the following Tuesday, but would', '> not appear on the weekly snapshot.  As of 6/20/01, J. Eastlund is no', '> longer ""overwriting"" daily or weekly tapes and is making ""new"" tapes going', '> forward.
