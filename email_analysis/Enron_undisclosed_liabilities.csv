Specifically, commodity disclosures should provide additional statistical and other information about these business activities, the associated risks involved and any trends.

Another executive was reassigned after raising alarms."", 'By Jake Tapper, Salon.com', ""Jan. 18, 2002 | In recent weeks, Enron executives have insisted that their controversial -- and ultimately disastrous -- accounting strategies were legally vetted. But Salon has learned that a law firm hired secretly by one of Enron's own attorneys last year recommended that the huge energy trader stop setting up the financial instruments whose exposure later drove the company into bankruptcy. "", 'At the heart of the Enron scandal are a series of complex partnerships that Enron employed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its books -- thus boosting both its quarterly profits and its credit level. Enron executives participated in these partnerships, earning millions of dollars in management fees and raising major conflict-of-interest issues. ', ""Embattled Enron CEO Ken Lay has attempted to justify the partnerships by noting that Enron's own staff attorneys as well as those at Vinson & Elkins, its powerful outside law firm, signed off on them. Despite this legal advice, it was reported earlier this week that one Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, raised serious questions about the propriety of the partnerships in a memo sent to Lay in late August. Salon has now learned of two other major instances in which Enron executives were told by company colleagues that the partnerships were deeply troubling and possibly illegal. "", 'In one case, an Enron staff attorney took the extraordinarily unusual step of secretly retaining another outside law firm to evaluate the legality of the partnerships set up by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. ', ""Last summer, before Enron was forced to reveal the actual state of its finances, Fastow moved to set up more of these partnerships. But Fastow's plan was blocked when an Enron attorney named Jordan Mintz took matters into his own hands. According to sources inside Enron, Mintz, who had just moved from the company's tax department to its finance department, was so concerned about the questionable nature of the partnerships -- and apparently so worried that Enron's attorneys were too close to the business schemes to judge them correctly -- that he sought a second legal opinion. "", '', ""Without the knowledge of his boss, Enron chief counsel James Derrick Jr., Mintz hired an outside firm far removed from Enron and its Houston-based firm, Vinson & Elkins, to take a fresh look at the questionable deals. After reviewing the partnerships, the respected New York firm hired by Mintz -- Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson -- recommended to him that Enron stop setting up the the shell partnerships. The New York firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to company executives urging Enron to halt the practice -- which they apparently did. In October, Enron fired Fastow. Last month, he hired celebrated attorney David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore during his Florida recount battles. "", 'Contacted Wednesday night, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. When asked about the Mintz retention of outside counsel, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said ""this is the first I\'ve heard of that"" and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Fried Frank did not return a call for comment. ', 'Without specifically confirming the Mintz episode, House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that worried Enron executives did go outside the company for legal advice: ""(This) happened in a couple instances. There was more than one person who was spooked by these partnerships."" ', ""It is unusual for a corporate lawyer to go behind the back of his boss, the chief counsel, and retain an outside firm to do work for a company. And it was against standard operating procedure at Enron, where chief counsel Derrick had to approve of any outside legal work. But Mintz apparently thought that Derrick, who had worked at Vinson & Elkins before joining Enron, was too much a part of the company's closed culture, in which dubious business practices had become the norm."", 'No less than 10 congressional committees are investigating the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to politicians in general and the Bush administration in particular. On Wednesday the Senate Finance Committee joined the ranks of nine other House and Senate bodies -- as well as the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- by announcing that it, too, would look into the largest bankruptcy in American history. ', 'On Wednesday, investigators with the House Energy & Commerce Committee interviewed David Duncan, the former Enron auditor with Arthur Andersen who had been fired the day before. ', 'One of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky ""partnerships."" Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. ', '""Someone should have stepped up and said, \'No, you can\'t do these sort of things!\'"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. ', 'Currently, much is being made in the media of Watkins\' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" Watkins wrote. ""The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax."" ', 'But Watkins\' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon\'s tribulation, writing that he ""was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him."" ', 'In the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon\'s new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon ""learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong,"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. ""He thought they were a huge conflict of interest."" McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, ""\'We have this problem, and I think there\'s a conflict.\' Skilling says, \'I\'ll take a look at it; I\'ll take care of it.\' And the next thing you know, he\'s reassigned. And it was not a promotion."" To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said. ', 'McMahon ""did go to Jeff Skilling and tell him he was uncomfortable with the internal and external conflicts the LJM partnerships were creating,"" confirmed Enron spokesman Palmer. ""And he told him he could no longer serve as treasurer with those conflincts in place."" As for whether the reassignment was a demotion of any sort, Palmer said, ""It\'s probably open to interpretation by a lot of people."" ', ""In August, the same month Watkins wrote her memo, Skilling himself resigned from Enron under mysterious circumstances. McMahon, who replaced Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in October, did not return a call for comment. "", '""We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon,"" House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. ""We feel he has a lot to offer."" Johnson\'s committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo.

By last fall, it was managing energy at more than 31,000 customer sites, and Enron's competitors have been salivating at the thought of picking up some of EES' business.

"", ""And not all Enron deals done during the energy market's bull run are necessarily at prices much richer than the current market. The contracts are highly customized. While fixed-price deals like the one with Harrah's were lucrative for Enron, many deals have flexible pricing that reflects, at least partially, the market correction. "", 'So, as long as Enron keeps delivering, some customers have little incentive to dump EES. ""For the most part, we\'re finding that customers are pleased to be on their contract, and they\'re waiting to see what the next step is,"" Mahoney said.

Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. "", ""What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest.

According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. "", ""Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)?

U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. "", ""Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm. "", ""Under U.S. accounting practice, if another party owns more than 3% of a special vehicle, its liabilities don't need to be reported on the majority holder's balance sheet. As Enron showed - though there are also suggestions of fraud - 97% of a liability can be a lot not to report. "", ""Another loophole is the failure of companies - especially high tech firms - to report a big component of their costs. For example, options paid to employees don't enter into the profit and loss account under U.S. GAAP rules. This can have a significant effect if a company pays employees in part with options. But the debate goes deeper than"", 'a matter of loopholes. ', '', ""Companies and investors have argued that accounting standards don't capture the truth of a company's performance, that underlying performance is hidden by the noise of special factors, and that things like goodwill accounting make a nonsense of the balance sheet. "", ""Its apologists, however, would have a stronger case if so many pro forma statements weren't such an obvious attempt to cheerlead or to obscure the audited numbers.

(ENE) scandal has finally gone nuclear.', ""Not that this comes as a tremendous surprise. So far, Enron has sullied the reputation of just about everyone who's had anything much to do with it, from its auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, to one of its primary bankers, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), to the rest of the energy-trading industry. Why should George W. Bush be any different? "", ""All along, the only thing this saga of financial hanky-panky has been missing - the element to give this story the critical mass to push it from the business pages to the front page - is a real whiff of political hanky-panky. A concrete indication that Enron had tried to use its status as a major benefactor of the president of the United States to its own advantage. That's what we got last week, when it was revealed that Enron executives had called Bush administration officials as the company spiraled toward bankruptcy, to try to coax them to take action to help save the company. "", ""Administration officials have said they took no such action, but that hardly matters at the moment. For purposes of determining the significance the public and press assign this story in the scheme of things, what matters is that Enron made the attempt at all. Outside the narrow confines of Wall Street, most people don't know from conflict-ridden off-balance-sheet partnerships or shady accounting practices ... but everyone understands influence-peddling and how wrong it is. A scandal-ridden company asks for special favors from an administration it helped pay to put in office? Oh, boy. Or, to use President Bush's now-well-publicized nickname for Enron's chief executive: Oh, Kenny Boy. "", ""Combine that with the near-simultaneous news that Arthur Andersen has shredded Enron-related documents - destruction of evidence being another bit of scandalous behavior that a layman can easily understand - and all of a sudden a complex financial story has been elevated to a thoroughly mainstream, they'll-talk-about-it-on-the-street-as-well-as-the-Street scandal. "", 'You want to know how mainstream this story is now? The three major network Sunday-morning talk shows, not usually renowned for their explorations of financial fraud, all spent copious amounts of time on the Enron story this Sunday. Dennis Miller cracked before Saturday night\'s NFL playoff game that the New York Jets, who had traveled between New York and California three times in a week, ""have been flying back and forth across this country more frequently than a bagman for Enron."" The topic of this week\'s Top Ten List contest on David Letterman\'s Web site: ""Top Ten Excuses of Enron\'s Executives."" That\'s how mainstream. ', ""The fact that there's no credible indication as yet that anyone in the Bush administration did anything improper about Enron isn't going to slow down the story one bit. The questions the Bushies face over Enron are at least as legitimate as the questions their predecessors the Clintonites faced for years over the Whitewater affair, and after congressional Republicans battered Bill Clinton for years with investigation after investigation, you'd better believe the Democrats are smelling payback. (Of course, the Democrats have to tread carefully; many of them got contributions from Enron too.) "", ""And it's an interesting quirk of timing, at the very least, that Bush's first in-depth public comments about the Enron fiasco came last week, just before the disclosures that may turn Enron into a major problem for his administration. "", ""It's kind of ironic: For weeks, the plight of thousands of Enron employees who've lost their retirement savings - Bush's fellow Texans, the bulk of them - couldn't make the broad public take much note of the Enron scandal, especially while the war in Afghanistan dominated the news. The prospect of a few highly placed people facing hard questions about what they did or didn't do on Enron's behalf has made people sit up and take notice virtually overnight. "", 'Where the investigation goes from here, no one can know. But for the first time, it appears President Bush, like others before him, may yet rue the day he first heard of Enron.

(ENE). The one-time industry leader's questionable financial practices and rapid descent into bankruptcy sent jitters through the market, forcing investors to re-evaluate whether the sector was on the wrong side of the tracks. "", ""Ratings agencies - particularly Moody's Investors Service - acting like a zealous neighborhood watch, tightened standards and gave ultimatums. Both Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) were faced with a credit rating downgrade that placed the companies below investment grade, while the ratings of Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) were put on watch for the same. "", 'Each energy merchant responded the best way it could. One by one, the companies began renovating balance sheets and launching recapitalization programs. ', 'Some threw out loans with triggers linked to credit ratings like bad shingles threatening to bring the roof down. Other firms moved off-balance sheet debt back onto financial statements, and announced ways to reduce debt and lower spending. Like so many corporate garage sales, assets - power plants, oil and gas properties, and even a refinery - went on the auction block, and new equity offerings were held. ', 'In other words, each company tried every way possible to show that despite the misdeeds of one neighbor, they were were all good corporate citizens. ', 'Investors and industry watchers may not agree on whether these balance sheet renovations were necessary improvements. But most will agree the changes are more than cosmetic, and will place the companies on the road to stronger performance. ', 'Susan Abbott, managing director at Moody\'s Investors Services, said the plans ""aren\'t just window dressing."" But she warned the magic will be in the execution. She is concerned that some companies may have difficulty raising additional funds through asset sales in what has quickly become a buyers\' market. ', '""From our perspective, the companies should sell assets that do not fit into the strategic plan,"" Abbott said. ""What are they doing owning these assets anyway?"" ', 'She expects oil and gas properties that have proven reserves will be among the first assets that will be divested, possibly in as little as 30 days. Other assets will take longer to sell.

', 'Equity Offerings Bought Time For Asset Sales ', '', '""Mirant raised equity,"" Abbott said. ""That\'s a good thing for them. Their ability to sell $1.5 billion of assets ... that will be the execution part we will be anxiously waiting to see."" ', ""If Mirant achieves its goals, and Moody's restores Mirant's investment grade status, the upgrade will be a catalyst for the stock, said Richard Giesen, manager of the Munder Power Plus fund. Giesen said he took advantage of Mirant's equity offering to add shares to his portfolio. "", '""I do think there\'s a good possibility Moody\'s could reverse (its downgrade) after the meeting with the company (this week),"" Giesen said. ', ""The Power Plus fund has roughly 9% of its assets invested in companies with energy trading operations, he said. As an investor in the sector, Giesen said he wishes the companies weren't forced to issue additional equity because of the earnings dilution. "", '""I wish they hadn\'t done it, but I realize it was a necessary evil given the circumstances,"" he said. ', 'To get a sense of the impact, Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Fleishman said his 2002 earnings estimates were reduced by an average of 15% for those companies who announced recapitalization programs. ', ""But earnings dilution wasn't the only reason why investors appeared to be universally critical of Moody's decision to raise the bar for sector. Many said it was wrong to change the rules overnight. "", ""Moody's Abbott said she is aware of the criticism. "", '""These companies have a need to grow,"" Abbott said, ""but the first step is to repair the balance sheets and establish a good relationship between cash flow and debt. ... Then the companies can focus on growth, but they can do it in a more balanced fashion, which means slower."" ', 'Market Waiting To Hear More During Earnings Season ', '', ""Fourth-quarter conference calls, which will begin this week, will give some of the companies in the group another chance to outline goals for the year. According to several portfolio managers, the market isn't likely to view aggressive growth plans favorably. "", ""Still, the portfolio managers aren't writing off the growth potential for the sector. "", '""California dodged a major bullet because of unseasonably mild weather,"" Giesen said. Mild weather and a weak economy are masking regional supply shortages and transmission grid problems that could again result in higher energy prices and improved earnings power in the sector, according to the portfolio manager. ', ""Plus, the potential for oversupplied markets has been reduced as some companies cancel plans for power plants, said Merrill's Fleishman. "", '""We note, however,"" the analyst said, ""that most of the 2002-2003 plants are already being built, so the benefit is mainly in 2004 and beyond."" ', ""There also is the chance of stock appreciation, even if the sector doesn't win back its growth moniker and the associated price-to-earnings multiples. According to Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, relative to expectations, some in the sector are not even trading at utility valuations, which means there is room to rise. "", 'Mullick favors El Paso Corp. (EP), which closed Friday at $41.77, and Williams Cos. (WMB), which ended the day at $25.50. Both stocks have come off the 52-week lows hit amid the heightened credit concerns last month, but the stocks remain sharply below their price ceilings. ', 'Investors said they were impressed by the ability of company managers to react to the new credit requirements. As a result, investors expect fourth-quarter conference calls to continue to stress debt reduction. ', ""The stocks could get a kick if the companies report they have been gaining market share in the wake of Enron's exit. This is most likely to come from market players such as Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), that had strong credit quality going into this period of uncertainty, some investors said. "", 'Going forward, Fleishman said he thinks it also is the companies with strong balance sheets that will be able to benefit from acquiring new assets on the cheap. He cited Duke, Entergy Corp. (ETR) and American Electric Power Corp. (AEP).
