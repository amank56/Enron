', ""  Cooper has more than 30 years' experience in leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.  He will be joined in his efforts by professionals from the restructuring consultancy, Zolfo Cooper LLC, that he helped create.

It's more likely, he said, that the judge will name an examiner to probe certain aspects of fraud or misdeed in the case. "", ""  To be sure, Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history, will likely remain prominent in the public eye as long as Congress continues its numerous investigations. Turnarounds are always sensitive matters, but it is rare for  the reorganizational efforts to be this public. "", ""  Cooper's experience may help him make the quick decisions that will be needed to tackle the job. "", '  But creditors will be looking for results fast, according to Charlie Rhoads, a partner at the Houston office of Boyden Global Executive Search. ', '  ""There is no honeymoon period because an interim CEO really falls under the role of a consultant,"" he said, explaining that there is less patience for results from an individual with this type of experience. ', ""  On Wednesday, Cooper gave a rough outline of his plan, and in it the new Enron looked very much like old pipeline company that gave birth to the original Enron. The company would retain its gas pipelines, and would assess whether to preserve or sell the rest. The businesses that might be sold include money-losing power plants in India and Brazil, Enron's broadband assets, and the water and wastewater business that were once part of Azurix Corp. "", '  One way to do this would be to combine the assets and the liabilities of all Enron subsidiaries. This move, called a substantive consolidation, would put some creditors at a disadvantage and result in them getting paid less for their claims. ', ""  With this in mind, some creditors have petitioned the court to segregate the cash flowing into one of Enron's units because they claim the parent company can't be trusted  to keep accurate records and divvy up the funds among the business units. The creditors want detailed accounts of the cash flows into Enron units. "", '  Given Enron\'s legal structure, Cooper believes it is ""highly probable"" that not all creditors will be treated equally. In other words, in the end, there just might not be  enough to pay off all creditors after the web of off-balance-sheet partnerships are untangled.

Gray Davis is facing an uphill race for reelection because of his handling of the energy crisis. Though prices and blackout fears have long since receded, the state is stuck with some $50 billion in overpriced long-term contracts negotiated by his appointees.

(EP), accused of withholding supply to drive up prices of natural gas. Now, it's Enron. The Democrats must deflect all blame from Davis in 2002's most important single race. "", '', 'What Really Happened ', '', ""So, why did northwest electricity prices fall even 16% at the time of Enron's bankruptcy? The price history submitted by McCullough backs up what traders have been saying for months: Enron had been seen shorting western power since last spring, making money as prices collapsed. "", 'That view was confirmed this week by the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal power marketer in the Northwest. A year ago, Enron was selling to Bonneville at an average price of $50/MWh. Later, Enron bought the power back at about $18, according to Bonneville. ', 'In October, as Enron\'s credit quality and survival were being severely questioned, the company ordered its traders to ""flatten their books."" For Enron\'s western traders, that meant getting out of their short positions by buying back power to reduce the risks in their portfolio.

The bear market for all U.S. energy markets - which has continued to this day - resumed for western power. "", ""Aside from the politics, we're talking big bucks. Several western utilities hold hundreds of millions of dollars in long-term contracts with Enron that are now way above the market. Those contracts didn't go away with Enron's bankruptcy filing. Just the opposite - they became major assets of the estate. If they hold up, the utilities will have to pay the entire difference between their contracts and the current market up front, in cash. "", ""If the utilities can prove Enron manipulated the market, they might be able to get federal energy regulators to invalidate the contracts. Even high-priced contracts signed with suppliers other than Enron - like Davis' - might be nullified based on Enron's market manipulation. "", 'As for Feinstein\'s rush to judge Enron as the culprit behind California\'s energy crisis, McCullough called that ""a leap of faith."" ', 'That crisis was in the spot market for power needed on a daily and hourly basis. As big as Enron was, it was never big enough to control the spot market for western electricity, which was enormous until California started buying everything under long-term contracts last summer. ', ""For all its questionable activities, Enron isn't to blame for California. The state botched deregulation under the leadership of the previous governor, Republican Pete Wilson. The Davis ignored the crisis for eight months, until after the state's two largest utilities were flat broke, and then largely botched the solution. "", 'End of story? Not a chance.

Enron argued for a separate clearinghouse for all energy trades in the state, which had little regulatory scrutiny and operated in virtual secrecy.

The memo outlines Enron\'s priorities for a national energy plan, and includes suggestions for how to solve the state\'s energy problems. Critics say it illustrates just how closely the administration\'s final plan mirrors Enron\'s priorities. Sen. Barbara Boxer called the memo ""a smoking gun.""

The memo also argues strenuously against implementing price caps on wholesale energy prices -- a key issue in the California energy crisis. Instead, Enron argued, the solution to the crisis should be more deregulation, not less. That closely mirrored Cheney's public comments the day after his meeting with Lay as politicians from both parties were calling for temporary caps. "", '""Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not yet reached consumers,"" the memo states. ""The administration should reject any attempt to re-regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps.""

"", ""Lay, it appears, had better access than California's highest elected officials.

Doug Heller, from the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, speculates that Cheney may be refusing to cooperate with the GAO because he's trying to cover up for his buddies at Enron, who Heller says artificially manipulated California's energy market.

', ""The pundits include a group of prominent political and economic commentators who in recent years (i.e., before former CEO Kenneth Lay replaced Osama bin Laden as Public Enemy No. 1) made their way onto Enron's payroll and received big bucks for doing very little work. Now they are being asked: How in good conscience can they comment on Enron's fall after cashing Lay's obscenely generous checks? "", 'The Enron sugar daddies include Weekly Standard editor William Kristol ($100,000), CNBC host and National Review Online columnist Lawrence Kudlow ($50,000), New York Times columnist Paul Krugman ($50,000), Weekly Standard contributing editor and Sunday Times of London columnist Irwin Stelzer (approximately $50,000) and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan ($25,000-$50,000; apparently she cannot recall the exact sum). ', 'We\'re assured this is a very big deal. ""The burgeoning scandal [has] replaced the war as the Beltway\'s reigning obsession,"" the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. ', ""A review of the charges makes clear that none of the Enron media players, who were all slow to cop to their Houston boondoggles, come out looking very good. But that also goes for their chief accuser, conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan. His selective prosecution raises suspicion about whether he is simply trying to right an ethical wrong or, more likely, hoping to damage one of the left's most effectively critical voices -- Paul Krugman, a former MIT economist who has landed punch after solid punch on the Bush administration over the past year. "", 'Right from the outset, Sullivan, using his daily online column, called for an ""investigation"" into Krugman\'s alleged ethical lapse. (By who, the Pundit Police? Is that run out of the Department of Justice?) He suggested Krugman and others ""recuse themselves"" from the Enron situation, the way Attorney General John Ashcroft did, since as a senator he received Enron contributions. According to Sullivan, the Times columnist should return his Enron money, just as Senator Hillary Clinton had returned the campaign contributions she\'d received from Enron. (In Washington, contributions and paychecks are seen as one and the same.) ', '""Disclosure is a must,"" wrote Sullivan. ""We demand it of politicians. Why should we not demand it of the journalists who police them? If it\'s corrupting for politicians, why is it any less corrupting for pundits, who can exercise as much power as many Congressmen and often have more influence than individual Senators? "" ', 'Yes, both politicians and the press depend on public trust, but the last time we checked pundits did not have the power to pass legislation, prosecute criminals or declare war. Nor were pundits answerable to the voters. Indeed, the level of importance granted by the media to this Enron media tempest is more proof than we need of the warped sense of self-importance such pundits have about themselves and their colleagues. ', ""The absurd levels of self-absorption are reminiscent of the time, early in George Bush's campaign, a Boston television journalist sprang a pop quiz on a befuddled W. While the cameras rolled, the reporter asked him to name several foreign leaders. Bush stumbled badly. More than a few pundits then rushed forward to defend Bush, suggesting even they wouldn't have been able to ace such a tough test. Their courage in admitting to just skimming the international news section every morning was commendable, but unlike Bush, those columnists weren't angling to become the leader of the free world. "", 'So, just what crimes did these pundits commit? ', 'Irwin Stelzer, contributing editor for the Weekly Standard and a columnist for the Sunday Times of London. ', 'To date, Stelzer still has not disclosed to readers how much he was paid to serve on an Enron advisory board that he helped organize. In a Weekly Standard piece about Enron last November, Stelzer defended the company by stressing there was ""no indication that the mistakes were other than honest ones, or that investors were deliberately kept in the dark or misled about the company\'s finances."" ', 'In that piece, Stelzer told readers about serving on the advisory board, but not that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars. This came after years of writing favorably about Enron without giving readers a hint of his financial ties to the company. ', 'Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard. ', ""Not much better than Stelzer's situation. Kristol collected $100,000 for serving two years on the same lightweight Enron advisory board while editing a weekly magazine that routinely covered energy and deregulation, policies Enron was actively trying to shape. It wasn't until Stelzer's column last November that readers were told about Kristol's Enron involvement. Just how much Kristol pocketed was revealed only later, by other publications. If there's an ethics crime for Sullivan to prosecute, it's the Weekly Standard's nonexistent conflict-of-interest guidelines. "", ""Last week, the New York Times reported that Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, was given a plum, $10,000-per-month consulting gig at Enron at the request of Bush strategist Karl Rove. The clear implication being that the Bush camp was trying to win over Reed as an ally by using Enron's payroll. Was a similar strategy at work with Kristol? Kristol was not known as a Bush booster -- he backed Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary. Could the board membership have been designed as a way to quietly lead him to the Bush camp? Only Enron execs know the answer to that question. "", 'Peggy Noonan, columnist for the Wall Street Journal. ', 'The conservative opinion maker outed herself last Friday; in a column critical of Enron and its culture of wealth, she informed her readers that she\'d once done speechwriting for the failed Houston energy company. Like almost everyone else involved, however, Noonan had trouble coming right out and telling readers how much she pocketed. Instead, she wrote that ""if memory serves,"" she earned between $25,000 and $50,000 for her work. But even those numbers were hard to come by -- readers had to calculate on their own the number of hours she worked (between ""100 to 200 hours""), and multiply that by the rate she charged ($250) in order to get the final eye-popping invoice. ', 'Noonan then admitted the speech she wrote for Enron wasn\'t very good and that only portions of it were even used. Yet going by her high-end estimate of 200 hours billed, Noonan spent five weeks straight, working 40-hour work weeks, to deliver contributions that, she conceded, ""weren\'t helpful."" ', 'After initially criticizing Noonan, Sullivan reversed course, writing that he\'d been ""a little harsh"" on her and that Noonan had been ""had"" and ""used"" by the energy giant. Some at Enron might quibble with that assessment. ', 'Lawrence Kudlow, cohost of CNBC\'s ""America Now"" and an editor for National Review Online. ', 'Kudlow earned $50,000 for a year\'s consulting and two speaking fees. In his National Review column on Monday, Kudlow claimed he had been ""completely forthcoming with respect to my brief consulting role with Enron and the fees I received for this consulting."" ', ""Not quite. Kudlow didn't reveal his generous fees until Sullivan began his Enron pundit watch. And that was after Kudlow had already written about the company without letting readers in on his Enron finances. "", 'When Kudlow finally did come clean, he explained he had been ""attracted by the personable Kenneth Lay."" Not Lay\'s checkbook, mind you, his personality. That was odd, because in his previous column Kudlow undressed the ""characters"" at Enron (presumably including Lay) who had ""no moral fiber, no character, no courage and no corporate responsibility."" ', 'Also worth noting is that it took Kudlow several months to even address Enron\'s Page 1 debacle. That seems like an odd oversight for somebody with the title of ""financial economics editor."" Did the Enron money help keep Kudlow quiet? ', 'Paul Krugman, columnist for the New York Times. ', ""This whole game of gotcha began when the New York Times, deep in a recent Enron news story, reported that Krugman had once received $50,000 to serve on Enron's now famous advisory board. Months earlier Krugman himself had informed readers about his Enron work but conveniently left out the five-figure number. Same was true when he wrote a puffy Enron piece for Fortune magazine in 1999; the advisory board was mentioned, handsome paychecks were not. (Today, Krugman is among Enron's harshest critics.) "", ""Sullivan's probably correct in his surmise that the numbers were originally left out because most Times readers, and even Fortune's white-collar readers, would probably be stunned to read about that kind of pay for two days' work. "", ""But Krugman, who cut his Enron ties when he joined the Times in order to comply with the newspaper's strict conflict-of-interest policy, flagged his association well before Enron cratered, which is more than any of the other pundits can say. "", ""By Sullivan's standards, though, Krugman's the worst of the bunch, and that's where Sullivan's partisan instincts drive his accountability crusade off the track. Rather than calling all the pundits out for not disclosing their questionable Enron paydays, Sullivan largely gives the other (conservative) commentators a pass, and zeroes in on the only liberal among them. "", 'For instance, assessing Kudlow\'s Enron writings, Sullivan concluded, ""Since [his] pieces were harshly critical of Enron, there\'s no scandal."" Yet no pundit this year has been as harshly critical of Enron as Krugman has, so why is his work a scandal? ', 'Applying a sort of retroactive responsibility, Sullivan accused Krugman of ""absconding with $50,000 worth of dirty money from a criminal enterprise."" Of course, Krugman took the money three years ago, long before Enron\'s problems were apparent. By contrast, Kudlow was cashing Enron checks for a speech given last August, just as the company was beginning to unravel. ', 'Sullivan patted Kristol on the back for ""getting [his $100,000 payment] out in the open."" In the open? Kristol pocketed twice as much as Krugman, yet the Weekly Standard still hasn\'t printed any details about Kristol\'s cushy Enron payment. ', 'Meanwhile, Sullivan accused Krugman and the New York Times of somehow trying to cover up his Enron affiliation. ""Most readers of the Times would think [the $50,000 payment] is relevant,"" Sullivan complained. Yet how did he find out about the $50,000? He read it in the New York Times. ', 'Later, Sullivan bemoaned ""vast amounts of corporate cash being handed over to journalists,"" and how those vast amounts ""might actually give an appearance of conflict of interest for a journalist."" ', 'But was Krugman a ""journalist"" in 1999 when Enron came calling? Over the years the economist has undoubtedly been a prodigious writer, with outlets in Fortune and Slate, among others. But to suggest Krugman was a journalist the way Noonan, Kristol, Kudlow or Stelzer are is disingenuous. In 1999 He was primarily known as a MIT professor of economics who, according to his own explanation, accepted the Enron gig based on a long tradition of high-profile economics professors cashing out at the expense of corporations. ', ""So why, after the fact, does Sullivan try to hold Krugman to a conflict-of-interest standard his future employer would insist upon? Was Krugman supposed to know in 1999 that later in the year he'd be hired by the New York Times, and therefore he shouldn't have accepted the Enron money? "", 'Krugman answered his critics by claiming he was being smeared by a ""broader effort by conservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left, hoping that some of it would stick."" ', ""He's onto something. Clearly, Krugman's constant flurry of punches over the last year have hit the White House in the gut a few too many times for some conservatives. And his punches hurt -- Krugman is an economist who knows his topic better than the White House does. He's also untainted by the Clinton sex scandals. (He joined the Times after those bloody battles had been fought.) And he's unusually blunt in his assessment that President Bush is either a fool or a liar for pushing his tax cut strategy. "", 'Sullivan may have inadvertently revealed his true motivation for targeting Krugman when he immediately launched another media crusade: criticizing the New York Times\' ""left-wing lurch"" in its aggressive Enron news coverage. (Specifically, Sullivan didn\'t think that a poll that found a vast majority of Americans felt Republicans, not Democrats, had close ties to Enron was Page 1 material.)

"", 'Analysts predict that with prices at current levels, projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the U.S. could be shelved or canceled.', 'Natural-gas prices, which reached highs of nearly $10 per million BTUs last December, had held to around $3 to $5 per million BTUs for much of the year. At $2 per million BTUs and below, producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production. ', 'Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand, fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric-utility demand. Nearby November futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $2.208 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. ', ""In the Boston area, however, different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region. Last week, the U.S. Coast Guard, under pressure from local lawmakers, indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor. LNG makes up 15% of New England's gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days. The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists. "", ""Already, relative to other areas, natural-gas prices have inched higher in New England, where natural-gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market. The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by 30 cents to $1.30 per million BTUs, said a spokeswoman for Distrigas, a unit of Belgium's Tractebel SA. But the lack of LNG isn't likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural-gas storage is used up. "", 'Richard Grant, CEO of Distrigas, says LNG has a 30-year safety record at the company\'s Everett, Mass., terminal. While LNG is flammable, he says it is unlikely to explode. He adds that ""there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual. But until we answer the concerns, we won\'t be able to bring a ship in here."" ', 'Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth-quarter projections for natural-gas prices last week. ""Prior to Sept. 11, we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back,"" said Jay Saunders, a Deutsche Banc analyst. ""But all that is out the window now."" Deutsche Banc is now estimating a 20% drop in winter demand in the industrial sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of total U.S. natural-gas consumption. The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage, which is on pace to be full by the end of October. ', 'While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers, such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural-gas demand is met. Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms, such as EOG Resources Inc., plan to moderate production in the next two months. Gas drilling-rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1,030 at the end of August. ', ""Even with the increased natural-gas drilling of earlier this year, overall natural-gas supply is expected to increase just 1% this year, as the country's mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them. The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates, increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence. "", 'Still, the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form. With prices high last winter, El Paso Corp. and Enron Corp., among others, said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas, which is gas compressed and frozen to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit. ""You will see some cancellations and some delays,"" predicts Marshall Adkins, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates in Houston. ', 'Natural-gas prices need to average $3 per million BTUs on the East Coast and $3.50 on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas, said Ronald Barone, an analyst with UBS Warburg.

"", 'In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE\'s annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in ""Patient But Not Passive,"" the story that accompanies the list, ""By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."" ', 'Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE\'s inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. ', 'As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley\'s Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz.

', 'While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: ""We consider the size and importance of a woman\'s business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman\'s influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year\'s list."" The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year\'s FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first.

And that\'s what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years."" Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. ', 'In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business.

"", 'The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. ', ""In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. "", 'In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE\'s annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in ""Patient But Not Passive,"" the story that accompanies the list, ""By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."" ', 'Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE\'s inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. ', 'As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley\'s Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. ', 'Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. ', 'While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: ""We consider the size and importance of a woman\'s business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman\'s influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year\'s list."" The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year\'s FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. ', 'In a related story, ""It Took a Lady To Save Avon,"" Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, ""Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that\'s what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years."" Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. ', 'In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan).

', 'Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors, it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer, as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income.

"", 'The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. ', ""In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. "", 'In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE\'s annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in ""Patient But Not Passive,"" the story that accompanies the list, ""By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."" ', 'Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE\'s inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. ', 'As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley\'s Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. ', 'Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. ', 'While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: ""We consider the size and importance of a woman\'s business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman\'s influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year\'s list."" The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year\'s FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. ', 'In a related story, ""It Took a Lady To Save Avon,"" Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, ""Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that\'s what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years."" Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. ', 'In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan).

About 95 percent of the plants that have been built or are under construction are fired by natural gas.

"", '', '""This just means California is particularly vulnerable to any supply disruptions nationwide,"" Heavner said. ', '', 'As demand is rising, natural gas production is waning, he said. There are 2 1/2 times the number of natural gas wells nationwide as there were in 1973, but each well produces a third as much gas, Heavner said. ', '', ""To stabilize the state's energy supply, CalPIRG recommends that officials encourage a broader mix of fuels by requiring utilities to buy 20 percent of their power from renewable resources.

', '', ' ', 'Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit', ' ', 'NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. ', '', 'The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. ', '', '""What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed,"" Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. ', '', ""The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. "", '', '""There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work,"" Angelides said. ', '', 'Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. ', '', 'Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, ""are not ready to act."" ', '', 'Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. ', '', 'How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. ', '', 'Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. ', '', 'In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. ', '', ""The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. "", '', 'Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. ', '', 'Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. ', '', ""Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said. "", '', '', '', '', ' ', 'State cautioned on reliance on natural gas ', '', 'SACRAMENTO -- California could face another energy crisis by relying too heavily on new natural gas-fired plants to boost electricity production, said the author of a study released yesterday. ', '', 'After a year of volatile natural gas prices, the state shouldn\'t depend too much on gas and should instead invest more in renewable energy, according to ""Predictably Unpredictable,"" a study by the California Public Interest Research Group. ', '', '""By putting all of our eggs in one basket, California is setting itself up for another energy crisis,"" said Susanna Churchill of CalPIRG. ', '', ""Even before the start of California's energy crisis, the state depended on natural gas for more than one-third of its energy needs, the report said. Eighty-five percent of that gas came from out of state. "", '', '""Because the state is so dependent on this one fuel source, the price spikes had a tremendous impact on our energy markets,"" the report says. ', '', 'Increasing that dependence will only cause future price spikes, said Brad Heavner, a CalPIRG policy analyst and author of the report. About 95 percent of the plants that have been built or are under construction are fired by natural gas. ', '', 'Natural gas ""is being treated as a magic bullet in this state and around the country,"" Heavner said. ', '', ""Natural gas is cleaner than coal and less expensive than nuclear, and the state's new fleet of peaker plants -- small gas-fired power plants that come online when demand is highest -- can be built quickly. "", '', ""But Heavner said California's demand for natural gas is rising faster than the federal Department of Energy forecast that calls for a 2.3 percent annual increase in the next 20 years. "", '', '""This just means California is particularly vulnerable to any supply disruptions nationwide,"" Heavner said. ', '', 'As demand is rising, natural gas production is waning, he said. There are 2 1/2 times the number of natural gas wells nationwide as there were in 1973, but each well produces a third as much gas, Heavner said. ', '', ""To stabilize the state's energy supply, CalPIRG recommends that officials encourage a broader mix of fuels by requiring utilities to buy 20 percent of their power from renewable resources. "", '', ""The new California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority has set a goal of increasing the state's renewable energy output to 20 percent by 2006, said Amber Pasricha, spokeswoman for the authority. "", '', 'The authority has signed 14 letters of intent for new renewable power plant projects, including 12 wind and two bio-fuel projects, she said. ', '', 'CalPIRG also recommends that state energy regulators deny any pending applications for natural gas-fired plants and offer government subsidies to renewable power providers and customers. ', '', 'The report also recommends the state review all contracts that the Department of Water Resources has signed with natural gas-fired power producers and explore canceling contracts that involve the construction of new gas-fired plants. ', '', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ""Alternative to state's SDG&E plan in works "", '', 'Approval of the state plan to eliminate the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers could be headed for delay or derailment. ', '', 'Consumer advocates and others say they will gather Monday in Sacramento to develop an alternative to the deal, which was announced by Gov. Gray Davis and the utility in June. ', '', ""Consumer groups have criticized the governor's plan to eliminate the so-called balancing accounts as costly to consumers and a windfall to the utility. "", '', ""The alternative proposal, which one consumer advocate says would save ratepayers more money, will be submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission for review. The commission had been set to complete its review of the governor's plan by the end of October. "", '', 'Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood, who crafted the timetable for the review, acknowledged yesterday that his schedule did not anticipate the need to consider an alternative proposal. Wood said it was unclear how long that might take. ', '', '""Much will depend on the perceived quality of the (alternative) plan,"" Wood said. ', '', 'SDG&E, meanwhile, said it had not decided whether it will participate in the Monday meeting -- called a ""settlement conference"" under PUC rules -- and criticized the scheduling of the event. ', '', '""We believe this is a delaying tactic designed to hijack this process,"" said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. ""This is designed to undermine the authority of the utilities commission and the governor."" ', '', ""Van Herik noted that components of the utility's plan have already been approved, while others remain on track. But a key issue -- whether customers or shareholders are entitled to hundreds of millions in profits SDG&E earned from selling power to the state -- has yet to be voted upon by the commission. "", '', 'Steve Linsay, a supervisor for the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, a state office charged with representing consumers, noted that PUC regulations require a settlement conference in cases such as this. ', '', '""By reaching a settlement with broad sponsorship, we hope the commission will give it the serious consideration it warrants,"" Linsay said. ', '', 'Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers\' Action Network, said an alternative proposal could eliminate the $747 million debt, lower customer rates and reduce ""windfalls"" for SDG&E at the same time. ', '', ""Consumer groups have been particularly critical of revelations that SDG&E earned hundreds of millions in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. They've also been critical of the profits they say Sempra will earn from future power sales. "", '', 'The governor and SDG&E say their plan contains significant concessions by the utility and eliminates the balancing accounts without raising rates. Under their proposal, the company agrees to return about $200 million in profits from the sale of electricity and pay $100 million to close an investigation into its electricity procurement practices. ', '', 'The utility says the balancing account arose when it paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers. The $747 million account amounted to a debt of $400 from each residential customer and higher sums from businesses. ', '', 'But in computing the debt, SDG&E has declined to fully credit the profits it earned from power sales to the state. The utility says those gains are the exclusive property of its shareholders', '', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Power Prices Splay Like Fingers on a $20 Hand', '', 'From top to bottom, there was not much difference between prices at Western hubs, with just about all peak transactions spread in a range from 20 mills/KWh to 27.5 mills/KWh midweek.

While analysts are confident that there will be an MOU passed, many are skeptical that the current proposals will be able to cobble together 41 votes in the Assembly.  The Davis Administration has said proceeds from the November bond sale will be used to repay the $6.2B borrowed from General Fund to purchase energy.  However, repeated delays in the bond sale have caused concern. And PG&E is upset that the money will be first used to pay off the state without offsetting some of the funds the state owes PG&E.', '', ""Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox has said that his members will not vote for any plan that is not a clean bailout (i.e. without additional provisions related to environmental mitigation).  Thus, he is essentially saying his members will vote for Assembly Member Rod Wright's proposal, and no other current plan.  But Wright's proposal does not have much support from Democrats.  Sources report that at least one prominent legislator, Senator Mike Machado, has apparently remarked that he is not certain of the need to pass an MOU.  Others may be muttering similar things, but an MOU is still likely."", '', 'Strangely, though, no discussions were held at the staff level this week on MOU legislation.  The key driver in the MOU debate is how much of a ""haircut"" SCE will be required to take (as a hit to the parent company).  Sources report that SCE will accept a haircut of $500M. However, should the haircut be placed in the range of $1B, we are told that SCE\'s Bryson has informed his team that he would take SCE into bankruptcy voluntarily. This represents a significant turnaround in SCE\'s previous optimism, which is attributable to legislative indifference to the SCE bankruptcy threat as well as growing tension between Bryson and Governor Davis.  As for the middle range between $500M and $1B, it is difficult to ascertain how high SCE will go before pulling the bankruptcy trigger.', '', 'Short Term-Anticipatory Notes', '', ""State Controller Kathleen Connell has asked for an emergency sale of a $5.7B short term note (possibly in the form of a Revenue Anticipation Note/RAN) to cover California's electricity costs until November, when $12.4B in state bonds are expected to be issue by the Legislature.  The State Controller's request was made because of her legal obligation to issue a demand to the Treasurer at any time she determines that the General Fund has or will have insufficient funds for the payment of all appropriations by the Legislature.  Connell claims the RAN, which could be offered as early as September, is necessary because the state's general fund is running dry from recent power purchases.  "", '', ""State Treasurer Angelides is studying the plan, but has yet to publicly comment.  According to sources, he has also yet to comment to legislators, but was in New York last week meeting with people on Wall Street about the bond issuance.  Mandated by state statute, Angelides can issue these notes unilaterally and does not need approval from the Legislature or anyone else.  He has total discretion on the issuance, its timing, and its amount.  However, the state's general fund would not be depleted by November 15th, even without the RAN revenue.  RANs are not that unusual.  RANs were previously issued from FY 95-96 through FY 99-00 with the largest being the $5B RAN in FY 92-93.  Because of California's recent economic growth, RANs were not necessary last year and were expected to be unnecessary this year. "", '', ""Concerns surrounding the PG&E suit filed earlier last week (PG&E seeks priority in the $12B revenue bond allocations) are somewhat eased by a well-placed utility source who report that the suit will have little impact the revenue bond or anticipatory notes' issuance.  However, there is suspicion among some that the Administration is increasingly concerned that investor confidence is weakening and that the bond issuance might be deemed a failure, and is thus promoting the idea that PG&E's actions are responsible, rather than investor uncertainty over revenue stream allocation and DWR contracts.

But Wagner, who =', 'mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums f=', 'or electricity ""that probably are higher than any overcharges"" for which th=', 'ey may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California co=', 'uld see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the po=', 'wer generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and util=', 'ities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a ""fast-track hearing=', '"" to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising=', "" from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he sai="", 'd FERC should use for calculating refunds.

And to give the impression that somehow there's been c="", 'ooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading,"" Kahn said.  The stat=', ""e's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The ="", '$8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid opera=', 'tor of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when=', ' wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially dupli=', 'cated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have b=', 'een if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect fo=', 'r the entire yearlong period.

But he s=', 'aid that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, an=', 'd should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calcula=', 'ted.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas=', ' heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market pr=', 'ices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rath=', 'er than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Tho=', 'se and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could incre=', 'ase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of over=', ""charges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to Octobe="", ""r would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.

DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Eve=', 'n as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gray Davis prepares =', 'for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power=', ' plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting =', ""task of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-la="", ""sting implications for state coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for ="", ""consumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by ="", ""the governor's office as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-="", 'control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically. A gr=', 'owing concern about the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicat=', ""ing one of Davis' most ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial r="", 'escue of Southern California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate =', 'in the Legislature. Questions about the contracts come as California readie=', ""s a complex $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund f="", 'or other power purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contrac=', 'ts, on top of the billions needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead =', 'to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer=', ' advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pact=', 's be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these=', ' critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts=', ' and lower some of the prices. They argue that the state entered into the d=', ""eals under duress after California's utilities neared insolvency and the st="", 'ate Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity f=', 'or more than 25 million residents.  ""They are vulnerable,"" Senate Energy Co=', 'mmittee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state s=', 'truck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs.  B=', 'owen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing ""the best deals the=', 'y could."" But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiati=', 'ons took place, ""the state had two cards and the generators had 50.""  Contr=', 'acts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, mor=', 'e immediately, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washingto=', 'n. There, an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be rework=', 'ed as part of a settlement of allegations by Davis that generators overchar=', 'ged the state for electricity by $8.9 billion.  ""We ought not to say, \'Fine=', ', the contracts were the best we could do,\' "" Bowen said.  For his part, Da=', 'vis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.9 billion in the=', ' form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He attributes th=', 'e recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation, the ad=', ""ministration's effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the lon="", ""g-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance on the volatile daily,="", ' or spot, market.  ""You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . =', '. dramatically shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Califo=', 'rnians,"" Davis said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30=', '% from May to June.  Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped nego=', 'tiate the contracts, said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, gi=', 'ven the recent decline in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for Califor=', ""nia's electricity-generating plants.  Freeman also compared critics to some="", 'one who calls the fire department to douse a blaze. ""After the fire is out,=', '"" he said, ""you complain about the water damage.""  The contracts have other=', ' defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein, =', 'who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing gene=', ""rators' incentive to drive up prices, while reducing the state's exposure t="", 'o wild swings in price.  ""The point of signing long-term contracts is not t=', 'o get a great price; it\'s to reduce risk,"" Borenstein said.  Still, experts=', ' have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in S=', 'an Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organiz=', 'ations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Davis unseal the c=', 'ontracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each rep=', 'resenting Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consume=', 'r group; and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-bill=', 'ion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the c=', 'osts. When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equip=', 'ment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an =', 'additional 10% to 20%.  ""Once the contracts were made public,"" Senate Repub=', 'lican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, ""just about anyone who ca=', 'n read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated.""  As buyers\' r=', 'emorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly are seen as =', 'a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront fast-approa=', 'ching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing =', 'into a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptc=', 'y for the financially hobbled Southern California Edison must be approved b=', 'y Aug. 15. The deadline could be tighter, because the Legislature is schedu=', ""led to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20.  Davis' rescue plan, along wi="", 'th legislative alternatives, languishes in the Legislature. The plan, which=', "" has little apparent support, would require the state to buy Edison's syste="", 'm of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and permit the utility to charge =', 'ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3.5 billion.  Some lobbyists a=', 'nd lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by th=', 'e California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the la=', 'rgest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue generated under the =', 'new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts an=', 'd repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would be the largest muni=', 'cipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for t=', 'he Edison rescue remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may n=', 'eed to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contr=', 'acts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk away from them if he=', ' concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism persists and crosses =', 'political lines.  Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers =', 'Union, and Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Tech=', 'nology Assn., rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in s=', 'eparate interviews, they sounded similar themes.  ""If there is a way to buy=', "" our way out of these contracts, even if we have to pay damages, we'd be be="", 'tter off in the long run,"" Snyder said.  Stewart, like other business leade=', 'rs, does not advocate abrogating the contracts. But like many familiar with=', ' the terms, he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated.  ""They are proble=', 'matic,"" he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricit=', 'y prices for the next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC t=', 'o agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by=', ' the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State=', ' Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the $13.=', '4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street i=', 'nvestors can be assured that they will be repaid.  ""The state will be out o=', 'f cash by the end of the year without the bond sale,"" he said. ""We will mov=', 'e toward fiscal insolvency.""  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of whic=', 'h was obtained by The Times, would bind customers of the three big regulate=', 'd utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the $13.4 b=', 'illion in bonds. Consumers would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to p=', 'ay taxes, fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by t=', 'he Department of Water Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated=', ' to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and sm=', 'all customers to cut electricity use, although the Legislature has not appr=', 'oved the programs and their details remain to be worked out. The Department=', ' of Water Resources estimates the cost to be $800 million, spread over this=', ' year and next.  ""It is loaded up,"" Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D=', '-San Francisco) said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would requir=', 'e the commission to ""raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water =', 'Resources decides to do.""  ""That is giving a blank check to some bureaucrat=', 'ic office,"" he said.  \'Dictatorial Power\' Warning  Stewart of the manufactu=', 'rers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it would provide the water a=', 'gency with ""dictatorial power.""  ""As skeptical as we are of the PUC process=', ', at least there is a process,"" Stewart said, referring to the commission\'s=', ' procedures to set electricity rates. ""There is no process for DWR. DWR jus=', 't tells the PUC, \'This is what we need,\' and the PUC must approve it.""  Oth=', 'ers say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the extraordi=', 'nary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department=', ' of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply in=', 'to debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers. =', ' In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January create=', 'd ""the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency"" beyond the jurisdict=', 'ion of the PUC.

""At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from =', 'the California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities=', ' in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges t=', 'hat (the state) may come up with.""  Now, it will be up to the federal regul=', 'ators to settle the case. But the recommendations by Wagner, who mediated t=', 'he talks, carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on th=', ""e state's chances of collecting the full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.="", '  The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings t=', 'o calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearing=', 's would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60 =', 'days, Wagner said.  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing=', ' session of the 15-day talks, which were ordered last month by the regulato=', 'ry commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and Ca=', ""lifornia officials before it reached the courts.  The judge's message was a="", ' sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially D=', ""avis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime less than $8.9 billion for="", "" California's consumers.  The governor issued a statement shortly after the="", ' close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the s=', 'tate is owed refunds.  ""I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodo=', ""logy for calculating refunds and rejected the generators' position that no ="", 'refunds are due,"" Davis said.  The governor\'s chief representative at the t=', 'alks, Michael Kahn, called the judge\'s statement a ""ringing endorsement"" of=', "" the state's call for refunds. Kahn said the judge's order would improve th="", ""e state's legal position if it files suit against power sellers.  GENERATOR="", ""S FAVORED But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.  Fo="", 'r example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8. 9=', ' billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though t=', 'he regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 200=', '0 could be considered.  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with t=', ""he October date, meaning that more than a third of the state's claim -- at ="", 'least $3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission.  Brent Bailey,=', ' vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North America, said that=', "" under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for $1 billion to $1.="", '5 billion.  ""Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California =', 'has been saying, it\'s a victory,"" Bailey said of the judge\'s statement.  Bu=', ""t Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with a ="", 'serious offer.  ""Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayer=', 's out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good f=', 'aith,"" Davis said.  $716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the=', ' generators had made an offer to California: $716 million in refunds.  The =', 'judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Big Fi=', ""ve generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 milli="", 'on by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six California =', 'municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-state power sel=', 'lers.  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it in=', 'cluded no cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of=', "" the state's debt off the books.  Throughout the talks, generators complain="", 'ed that the California team was trying to shield some California companies =', 'and government power providers from having to pay any refunds, and trying t=', 'o disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies.  FAVOR=', 'ITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to=', ' remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego=', ' Gas & Electric., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other g=', 'overnment power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refun=', 'ds, even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone el=', 'se.  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis mad=', 'e a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to comprom=', ""ise on the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputa="", 'tion would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.

The judge o=', 'verseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the re=', 'funds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars. His=', ' estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power suppliers dur=', 'ing negotiations. The offer was rejected by California officials.  But it w=', 'as unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail, and=', ' California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court. At=', "" stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimately have t="", ""o pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system collap="", ""sed.  Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will ="", 'recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating =', 'back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=', 's such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the e=', 'nergy suppliers had advocated during the talks.  Michael Kahn, who headed t=', 'he California negotiating team, said the state would contest some aspects o=', 'f the formula. But even without changes, Kahn said he was confident the for=', 'mula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated.  ``We think the num=', ""bers even using the judge's formula are going to be in the multiple billion="", ""s,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System Operator, which ru="", 'ns the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9 billion dollars. If=', "" we don't get all of it from the commission . . . we'll still get the remai="", ""nder of the money'' through the courts.

Wagne="", 'r acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula, saying =', 'he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers=', '.  The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last mon=', 'th when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=', ' prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that und=', 'er pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the =', 'power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigat=', 'ion.  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal, par=', 'ticipants said.  ``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on =', ""one end and you saw $716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to="", "" splitting the difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties ge="", ""nuinely wanted to settle. Others didn't.''  Wagner now has until Monday to ="", 'make his recommendation to the five-member commission, which will make the =', 'final ruling on refunds. To date, the commission has ordered $125 million i=', 'n refunds for periods since last Oct. 2.  Wagner said Monday that he will a=', 'sk that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed=', ' information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refun=', 'd total using his formula.  The state may not end up with any cash, as any =', 'refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and=', ' its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers.  Reflecting the tone =', 'of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday blamed power supp=', 'liers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve=', ' the situation.  ``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepay=', 'ers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good=', "" faith with our team in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past="", ' the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have th=', 'e opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California=', "" has demonstrated it is owed.''  Davis may go to court  At the opening of a="", ' new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis told reporters tha=', ""t he's prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesn't order="", "" the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of $8.9 billion doesn'="", 't represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates put the figure as =', 'high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about how those figures =', 'were calculated.  John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy W=', 'holesale Group, said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.=', '9 billion figure.  California officials and several suppliers said they wou=', 'ld continue to negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Ca=', 'lpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state.  Power supp=', 'liers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissi=', ""ons' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner said he w="", 'ill do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed for it. W=', 'agner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power s=', 'uppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State officia=', ""ls wanted it to cover up to May 2000.  $3 billion difference  The state's $="", '8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001. Factoring refunds =', 'beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion in overcharges the=', ' state says occurred in the earlier period.  Among the changes to the commi=', ""ssion's formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing elect="", 'ricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants the price limit determined f=', ""or each hour of each day. The commission's formula sets a price limit durin="", 'g Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergen=', 'cy.  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University ec=', 'onomist Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge w=', ""ill produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.  ``That's the methodology="", "" the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the California ISO on market iss="", ""ues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour, you'll get refund numbers ="", ""on the order of what the state estimated.''

The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts a=', 'nd other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy mar=', 'kets, according to documents that the state agreed to release last week ami=', 'd a legal dispute over public access to the data.

The docu=', 'ments raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen=', ' around the electricity crisis.

But the documents fail to shed much light on w="", 'hether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term=', ' power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend=', ' that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit t=', 'he state to pay high prices for many years.  Used for support  Republican o=', 'fficials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis,=', ' a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as =', 'the price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of th=', ""e declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants.  ``It's more cle="", ""ar than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' said Assemblyma="", ""n Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt the ratepayers="", "" for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the v="", ""olatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour ="", 'ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices f=', 'rom seller to seller varied widely, with some of the highest prices being c=', 'harged by public utilities and companies outside Texas.

The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of =', 'overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compu=', 'te the complex pricing structure.

To start with, the state is asking for ="", '$8.9 billion, but about $3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened be=', 'tween May and October 2000, a period FERC is not looking at.

The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving=', ' the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which=', ' the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of ab=', 'out $1 billion. California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it =', 'would seek that much and more, through the courts if necessary.  Although e=', 'lectricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the power crisis =', 'that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be=', ' resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should hav=', 'e cost during the last 13 months.  The power market has been mired in an ac=', 'counting gridlock. The state claims that generating companies began grossly=', ' overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 2=', '0 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year. Generators=', "" say they are prepared to pay some refunds, but argue that California 's es="", 'timates of overcharges are radically inflated.  The mediator in the settlem=', 'ent talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge for the fed=', 'eral agency, who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the c=', 'omprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought.  Mr. Wagner said he would =', ""recommend to the agency's commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidenti="", 'ary hearing that would impose an administrative solution. He also said he w=', 'ould suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity .  Under =', ""federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''just and ="", ""reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last year th="", ""at California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently began="", ' imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations o=', 'f past overcharges systematically.  While the scope of any refunds remains =', ""uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks appeared more favorable for generators than="", ' for Western states, which have collectively pressed for as much as $15 bil=', 'lion in refunds.  Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California sho=', 'uld have paid for power since last September, when the commission began mon=', 'itoring California energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroact=', 'ively apply a price control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated t=', 'hat he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is=', ' closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forwar=', 'd by California officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recom=', ""mending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''mayb="", ""e a billion'' dollars.  California officials gave a positive cast to the ju="", ""dge's statements, calling them a step forward because he formally acknowled="", 'ged that companies would have to pay some refunds. They also noted that wha=', 'tever the level of federally mandated refunds, they would have the option o=', ""f seeking more in court.  ''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' s="", 'aid Michael Kahn, who represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talk=', ""s. ''If we don't get it all from the commission, we will get the remainder ="", ""in the courts.''  Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did ="", 'not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue=', "" generators for $18 billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generato="", ""rs, mostly out of state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said,="", ' speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California=', ' .  Representatives of several generating companies said that during the se=', 'ttlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500 m=', 'illion. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge w=', 'ould result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their =', ""offer than to California 's demand.  Still, several executives said they no="", 'w hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the t=', 'hreat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dol=', 'lars they say they are owed by the state and its leading, financially press=', ""ed utilities, which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year.

All Rights Reserved  California consumers were over=', 'charged by as much as $1 billion by electricity suppliers since October, a =', 'federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power=', ' suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges.  Gov. Gray=', ' Davis (D) and California power officials wanted $8.9 billion in refunds da=', ""ting back to May 2000, when the state's energy crisis began.  A group of ge="", 'nerating companies headed by units of Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc=', '. and Williams Cos. offered refunds of $716.1 million in the past week, goi=', 'ng back to October. The companies said refunds should be offset by the larg=', 'er amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state.  ""The nu=', 'mbers were too far apart,"" Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal=', ' Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporters after two weeks of closed neg=', 'otiations ended yesterday. Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was i=', 'mprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the f=', 'igure.  Calpine Corp. of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expec=', 'ted to reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.  ""A lot=', ' of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn\'t,"" Wagner told =', 'reporters. ""There\'s an old southern saying,"" said the 72-year-old Tennessea=', 'n. ""You can take a horse to water, but you can\'t make it drink.""  He declin=', 'ed to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted California offic=', 'ials for not modifying their initial demands.  Wagner said he will send his=', "" own refund formula to FERC's five commissioners within a week. His formula="", ' essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices woul=', 'd have been in the state at various times since October, considering fuel c=', 'osts and other factors. Charges over those levels would be subject to refun=', ""d, if FERC agrees.  The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considera="", ""ble weight with FERC's commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier="", ' this year, FERC tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first =', 'three months of this year, an amount that Davis called far too low.  Facing=', ' increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new members =', ""appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California 's pow="", 'er prices. Last month, the commissioners imposed price restraints on wholes=', 'ale power transactions in California and 10 other western states. Wagner pa=', ""tterned his formula after FERC's ruling last month.  The nation's wealthies="", 't state has been battered by an extraordinary surge in electricity and gas =', 'prices that have pushed its electricity costs up from $7 billion in 1999 to=', ' an estimated $27 billion last year. Power prices did not retreat from reco=', ""rd levels until last month.  Davis's top aides quickly claimed vindication ="", 'yesterday.  ""We think the numbers, even using the judge\'s formula, are goin=', 'g to be in the multiple billions,"" said Michael Kahn, chairman of the Calif=', ""ornia Independent System Operator, the state's power grid manager.  Kahn no="", 'ted that the state refused to drop a growing list of legal claims against t=', 'he principal energy suppliers, most of them headquartered outside the state=', "". The companies had insisted on being released from the state's legal claim="", 's as part of any settlement, according to sources close to the negotiations=', '.  ""We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for =', 'the remainder,"" Kahn said. "" California will get its $8.9 billion.""  But th=', ""e state's own expert witness, economist Eric Hildebrandt, chief market moni="", 'tor for the California grid, testified before Wagner that the out-of-state =', 'generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about $3.7 billion=', "" using FERC's pricing formula of last month -- less than half the $8.9 bill="", 'ion goal.  Duke Energy is ""very pleased\'\' by Wagner\'s action, said Brent Ba=', 'iley, vice president and general counsel of the Charlotte-based company. Th=', 'e generators, however, repeated their claims that Davis is trying to make t=', ""hem scapegoats for the state's failed electricity deregulation plan.  The m="", 'ajor generators, in a statement yesterday, said they had delivered only 20 =', 'million megawatt hours out of the 145 million the state power grid used fro=', 'm October 2000 to last May. (A megawatt supplies enough power for about 750=', ' homes.)  California utilities and municipal power companies also reaped la=', 'rge profits, the generators said.

""We haven\'t reached a settlement. We =', 'really haven\'t come close,"" said John Stout a senior vice president of Reli=', ""ant Energy Inc.'s wholesale-power group. Reliant had offered to pay Califor="", 'nia about $50 million to extricate itself from the fight.

Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 mill=', 'ion to settle the matter.  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the =', ""agency's authority and credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwate="", 'r, has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monito=', 'ring of deregulated California markets. The commission has ordered some com=', 'panies to pay refunds, but they have been relatively small -- such as a $12=', '4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu=', 'ary and February.  California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER=', 'C members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to =', ""act quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterda="", 'y, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov.

""We would be very interested in i=', 't,"" said Ed Yates, senior vice president of the California League of Food P=', 'rocessors.  Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, =', 'requiring some plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for =', 'more than a day.  Some processors might choose to close on days when they f=', 'aced a blackout, he said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands=', ' of pounds of food.  ""It doesn\'t solve the problem, but it helps manage a v=', 'ery difficult situation,"" he said.  Briggs said that his plan would result =', 'in possible blackout days every two weeks. The plan would assume that a cer=', 'tain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operatin=', 'g. If the electricity shortage went above that amount, people might still f=', 'ace unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.  One question is public safety. S=', 'ome are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur.

The clam="", 'or of machinery and trucks -- sounds that meant prosperity here -- is gone.=', "" Employees have painted Oildale's machinery, insulated the boilers and twea="", ""ked the motionless 13-ton turbine.  Now they wait.  ``It's kind of like a s="", ""keleton,'' says plant manager Mike Pankratz, surveying the octopus-tangle o="", 'f pipes and tanks.  Choked by the $10 million Pacific Gas & Electric Co. ow=', 'es it, Oildale shut down Feb. 6, taking its 40 megawatts of badly needed el=', 'ectricity with it. The hush here is the sound of small generators locked in=', "" one of the most serious issues of California's energy crisis -- one that s="", 'tate regulators plan to wrestle with today.  Oildale is part of a growing l=', 'egion of small generators, from geothermal to gas-fired co-generation plant=', ""s, battling California's utilities and state price controls they say are cr="", 'ippling them. These small generators, owed about $1.5 billion, supply up to=', "" a third of California's electricity.  At least 25 have sued Southern Calif="", ""ornia Edison over unpaid bills. Four have sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy ="", 'proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least 19 smal=', 'l generators, including Oildale. In many cases, these companies want to end=', ' their long-term supply contracts with the utilities so they can sell their=', ' electricity on the more lucrative open market.  ``What this is, basically,=', "" is the revolt of the mice,'' said Bill Short with Ridgewood Power Manageme="", 'nt, a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gas-fired generators in Cali=', 'fornia and sued PG&E.  Officials to weigh debt  The companies are hoping fo=', 'r action from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is schedule=', 'd today to weigh whether to order the utilities to pay the back debt. Meanw=', 'hile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by d=', 'isgruntled generators and counter motions from PG&E.  The deteriorating fin=', 'ances of some of the approximately 690 small generators threatens Californi=', ""a's fragile power supply just as the state heads into the summer months up ="", 'to 3,700 megawatts short.  The deep and often unexpected economic impacts o=', ""f California's energy crunch add up daily. In Oildale's case, the shutdown ="", 'not only jeopardizes the jobs of its 10 anxious employees, but those of mor=', ""e than 150 employees at the refinery next door.  It's one of the biggest pu="", 'blic policy botches in the energy crisis, some energy experts argue. Califo=', 'rnia is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clea=', 'n and efficient small power suppliers in its own back yard, they say. Gas-f=', 'ired co-generation plants, which provide power to nearby businesses and sel=', 'l electricity to utilities, are some of the most efficient producers in the=', ' state. And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like t=', ""he sun and garbage fumes, lessening the state's dependence on high-priced n="", ""atural gas.  ``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while ="", ""we're paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else="", "", this is just nuts,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University ="", 'of California Energy Institute, mentioning companies that own major power p=', ""lants in the state. ``This is really a major blunder.''  The immediate cris="", ""is started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained. That's when PG&E ="", 'told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in Decembe=', ""r. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz said, which halted the="", "" plant's supply.  Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine.  The move socked="", ' Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over Oildale. Unable =', 'to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies, Golden Bear canno=', 't heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces. Golden Bear filed for b=', 'ankruptcy April 23. Last week it announced plans to lay off 172 employees. =', "" Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale, Golden Bear's exclusive ="", 'source of steam heat for nearly 20 years, was a key reason his group bought=', "" the refinery four years ago. Having it go under was ``gut-wrenching,'' he ="", 'said.  Power unavailable  The California Independent System Operator, keepe=', ""r of the state's electricity grid, reports that 1,400 megawatts of power fr="", 'om small generators are off line. It estimates that about half of that -- 7=', '00 megawatts, or energy for as many as 700,000 homes -- is due to the finan=', 'cial squeeze of natural gas prices, money owed by the utilities or both. Ot=', 'hers say financial problems have 1,100 megawatts off line.  Lawmakers haven=', ""'t been much help. The state Assembly on March 22 rejected a hastily crafte="", 'd rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies. The issue has languis=', 'hed in Sacramento.  Days later, the utilities commission ordered California=', ""'s utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future ="", '-- which saved many of them -- but it did not order the utilities to pay th=', 'e hefty back-due amounts. It also set a new rate for what utilities should =', 'pay the generators for electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too =', ""low for business, some argue.  The commission's position has been that the ="", 'small generators should abide by their existing contracts, said commission =', 'attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the extent that some of them are facing financial=', ' hardship, the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to =', ""help them vis-a-vis the back debt.''  The lack of stronger action to suppor="", ""t these generators baffles some critics.  ``It's like talking to a starving="", ' man on a desert island and saying, `How long can you hold up until the shi=', ""p comes?' '' said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficien="", 'cy and Renewable Technologies.  Some of the companies have appealed to the =', 'Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but regulators are waiting to see if =', ""the state and the courts can resolve the issue.  ``We're in what essentiall="", ""y amounts to an abusive relationship,'' said Short with Ridgewood, the inde="", 'pendent generator that has sued PG&E.  Two courts have allowed generators f=', 'ighting Edison to suspend their contracts. Five have lost their fights. Ano=', ""ther five have won the right to put a lien on Edison's assets.  In PG&E's b="", 'attle, three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy. In=', ' the fourth, a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had termina=', 'ted before the bankruptcy.  As for Oildale, it wants PG&E to pay the $10.5 =', 'million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market=', "". It also wants PG&E to pay what it calls ``a fair market value'' for its e="", ""lectricity.  If Oildale can't sell on the open market soon, it will be forc="", 'ed into bankruptcy, its attorneys argue. Pankratz estimates his plant can h=', 'ang in limbo only three more months.  PG&E is fighting to keep its small ge=', 'nerators, which it says are exaggerating their damage. It reports that only=', ' a tiny fraction of its 300 generators are off line.  Increased costs  If t=', 'he plants were released from their contracts, PG&E could not afford to pay =', 'the extra $284 million per month it estimates electricity would cost. The s=', 'tate Department of Water Resources -- and ultimately ratepayers -- would ha=', ""ve to foot that bill.  A fast solution isn't likely from the bankruptcy cou="", 'rt. The judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated =', ""legal questions.  Meanwhile, the clock ticks.  ``We've all been a little te="", ""nse,'' says Judy Andreatta, who has worked Oildale's front desk for 10 year="", ""s and worries about her job. ``It's just so scary watching everything happe="", ""n.

Davis' deal, some have complained, is sweeter for Southern C="", 'alifornia Edison than for taxpayers. So at least four proposals are being f=', 'loated to supplant that plan. But legislators are far from a consensus on a=', 'ny of them. Plans emerge, recede and are reconfigured daily.  Energy expert=', 's and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling could resu=', 'lt in what neither side wants: bankruptcy for Edison.  Bankruptcy means the=', ' state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and Pacific Gas & Ele=', 'ctric - which is already in bankruptcy - complete the Chapter 11 process, w=', ""hich could take years, experts and lawmakers said.  The state's wallet woul="", 'd shrink, affecting its ability to build schools and roads. Ratepayers migh=', ""t be on the hook for an additional $1 billion for the company's legal fees,="", ' because bankruptcy would freeze its assets, said Brian Bennett, vice presi=', ""dent of Edison International, the utility's parent company.  Southern Calif="", ""ornia Edison has said it's willing to be flexible on the governor's plan, w="", ""hich calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission grid for $2.76 billio="", 'n. Company officials wouldn\'t comment on the various alternatives.  ""We und=', 'erstand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are op=', ""en to variations on it,'' Bennett said.

""Edison is going to=', "" survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Public Utilities Commiss="", 'ion from 1986 through 1991 and a past president of the agency. But the ques=', 'tion is ""whether it will survive via the (plan) that the governor negotiate=', 'd or they do the same kind of thing PG&E did.""  ""There is still a very real=', ' risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers to=', ""o much with the deal, or fails to move ahead promptly,'' Wilk said.  PG&E c="", 'hose to file Chapter 11 last month because it was dissatisfied with the pro=', ""gress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company. PG&E's m="", ""ove was an embarrassment for Davis, who had vowed to keep the state's big u="", 'tilities solvent.

As long as the company stays =', 'out of bankruptcy, they have something to trade.""  Edison\'s creditors are s=', 'till waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature. Some have a=', 'greed to defer receiving payments until the end of June.  Dean Vanech, pres=', 'ident of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot of things need to=', ' happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison into bankru=', 'ptcy.  ""In general, we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope=', ' in a deal being made,\'\' Vanech said. But, he admitted, ""there\'s a concern =', 'that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of =', ""time.''Meanwhile, Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve ="", 'the transmission deal.

Lawmakers cringed at some elements of th="", 'e plan, which many thought was overly generous to Edison: limiting investig=', ""ation of the utility's parent's company and guaranteeing the company an 11.="", '6 percent annual return on investment.  Alternatives include: requiring pow=', 'er generators to accept up to one-third less than the collective $3.5 billi=', ""on they're owed; taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off="", ' its debts; and allowing Edison to build more power plants. The latest prop=', ""osal would require the state to sell bonds to pay off Edison's debts and gi="", 've the state the option to buy the transmission lines later. Most of the pr=', 'oposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off deb=', 'ts.  One hurdle the legislature faces: rallying two-thirds of each house be=', 'hind one plan, necessary any time the state spends money. Republicans have =', 'been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines, and half the =', 'alternatives include that element.

By contrast, Pacific Northwest hydroelectric capacity was ', 'depleted by an estimated 3,000 MW from the second to the third quarters in ', '1999 as a result of slower snowpack melt. This provided unseasonably high ', 'hydroelectric availability in the Pacific Northwest through the third and ', 'fourth quarters. The combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a ', 'normal-weather year in 2000, a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a ', 'second quarter peak, and higher West-wide demand will increase the pull on ', 'nonhydroelectric generation resources (see Figure 4).', '', '*  Energy exports to California. Sustained hydroelectric availability in 1999 ', 'in the Pacific Northwest allowed exports from the region to California to ', 'remain strong through the third and fourth quarters, with exports at 150 and ', '290 percent of normal, respectively. Exports added roughly 1,400 average ', 'megawatts (aMW) above average--and as much as 2,000 aMW in August--to ', ""California's resource base throughout the year. For 2000, CERA expects normal "", 'hydroelectric exports to average roughly 2,000 aMW (total of 17,500 GWh) ', 'during the year and 2,400 aMW (total of 5,300 GWh) in the third quarter (see ', 'Figure 5).', '', 'In 2000 the combination of normal load growth, normal spring and summer ', 'weather, and reduced hydroelectric availability will cause capacity margins ', 'to shrink, particularly in California (see Figure 6). The impact on power and ', 'gas prices will be', '', '*  Higher average power prices. Lower average streamflows will diminish the ', 'output of run-of-river hydroelectric facilities during peak summer demand ', 'periods. As runoff dwindles into the summer, production from reservoir-fed ', 'facilities is available for a decreasing period of the on-peak hours. Other ', 'generation resources, particularly gas-fired, will be used to meet demand ', 'during a growing number of shoulder and off-peak hours in 2000. On-peak power ', 'prices will be driven higher by the increased use of gas-fired generation ', 'during shoulder hours. Off-peak power prices will respond to the greater ', 'reliance on gas-fired generation during those hours.', '', '*  Higher average gas prices. Gas demand for power generation is expected to ', 'increase by 600 MMcf per day on average in 2000 and by up to 1,200 MMcf per ', 'day in the third quarter. This will contribute to price strength in western ', 'gas markets and to the higher costs of generating power.', '', 'Natural Gas Market', 'Although the effects of a return to normal hydro conditions become most ', 'evident in the third quarter as overall generation loads increase, CERA ', 'expects that some decline in hydroelectric output relative to last year is ', 'already causing a modest increase in gas demand in California. Although ', 'January West Coast weather has been comparable to last year, flows into ', 'California are up by 300 MMcf per day so far this month; storage withdrawals ', 'are up on a year-over-year basis as well. Based on the lower snowpack and ', 'lower average precipitation in California this month relative to last ', 'January, in-state hydroelectric generation explains approximately 400 MMcf ', 'per day of increased gas demand.', '', 'Normal hydroelectric generation this year will likely bring a 250 MMcf per ', 'day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first ', 'quarter. Early indications of normal-to-above-normal snowpack and ', 'precipitation in the Pacific Northwest should center these increases in ', 'California.', '', 'This modest demand increase has helped support prices in the western markets, ', 'with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well. ', 'Weather in both the United States as whole and the West averaged 10 percent ', 'warmer than normal during December, but during January temperatures in the ', 'West averaged only 8 percent warmer than normal while temperatures in the ', 'United States averaged 30 percent below normal.', '', 'Western Regional Prices', 'Over the next two months as seasonal heating loads within the West begin to ', 'tail off and hydroelectric generation increases modestly, differentials ', 'between western producing basins and the Henry Hub should widen. At the same ', 'time, as required flows into California decline, the Topock premium above ', 'Henry Hub prices should decline, with prices eventually falling below the Hub ', 'price. However, with normal weather in the West, that general weakening in ', 'western prices will likely take place toward the end of February and into ', 'March. Given the warm January, CERA expects heating load to decline by only ', '400 MMcf per during February. Loads look sufficient to sustain western ', 'differentials near current levels.', '', 'California', 'As more normal winter weather takes hold in the East, prices should increase ', 'in that market relative to California.

Table 1 shows expected flows ', 'into California for winter 1999/2000 compared with winter 1998/1999. That ', 'weakening in the Topock differential is limited, however. Expected lower ', 'storage inventories in California relative to last year, as well as a low ', 'upside to eastern prices, should keep Topock prices from falling more than ', '$0.05 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during February. Topock prices are ', 'expected to maintain a $0.03 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub price (see ', 'Table 2).', '', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Although some cold weather in the Pacific Northwest has held Malin prices ', 'close to Topock prices during January, CERA expects the Malin price to weaken ', 'relative to Topock during February--and more dramatically in March. Two ', 'factors are expected to contribute to this weakening:', '', '*  Hydroelectric output. Although February will bring a decline in heating ', 'load in both the Pacific Northwest and California regions, gas will receive ', 'some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in ', 'California. In the Pacific Northwest gas demand is limited during spring even ', 'in normal hydroelectric generation conditions.', '', '*  Canadian flows. Flows to the West Coast on Pacific Gas Transmission during ', 'the first quarter of 1999 dropped from an average of 2.6 Bcf per day during ', '1998 to 2.4 Bcf per day as Canadian supplies headed into the Midwest on the ', 'Northern Border expansion. This year, given the year-over-year increase in ', 'Canadian supply, those flows into the Pacific Northwest should rebound to ', '1998 levels.', '', 'The Topock-Malin differential so far this month has averaged only $0.06 per ', 'MMBtu. During the first quarter of 1999, that differential averaged $0.09 per ', 'MMBtu. Because of the forces described above, CERA expects a wider ', 'differential--$0.13 per MMBtu--this February.', '', 'Rocky Mountains', 'Similar forces will drive a widening in Rocky Mountain prices relative to ', 'prices in the south. Regional Rockies supplies are likely to increase as ', 'regional demand declines--although warm January weather will limit declines ', 'to 100 MMcf per day during February.
